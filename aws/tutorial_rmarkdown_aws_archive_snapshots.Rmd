## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{python, engine.path="/Users/markstephenson/anaconda/bin/python"}
import psycopg2
import os
```

```{python, engine.path="/Users/markstephenson/anaconda/bin/python", eval=FALSE}
rdsconn = psycopg2.connect(database='your_db', user='user', password="pw", host='your-rds.rds.amazonaws.com', port='5432')
rdscursor = rdsconn.cursor()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
